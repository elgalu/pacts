      duplicate_pacticipant: |
        This is the first time a pact has been published for "%{new_name}".
        The name "%{new_name}" is very similar to the following existing consumers/providers:
        %{existing_names}
        If you meant to specify one of the above names, please correct the pact configuration, and re-publish the pact.
        If the pact is intended to be for a new consumer or provider, please manually create "%{new_name}" using the following command, and then re-publish the pact:
        $ curl -v -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\": \"%{new_name}\"}" %{create_pacticipant_url}
