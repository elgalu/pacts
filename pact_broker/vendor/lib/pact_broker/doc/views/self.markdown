# Pact Broker

The Pact Broker is a repository for pacts. It provides a way to share pacts between consumer and provider projects as well as providing:

* autogenerated documentation
* autogenerated network diagrams
* webhooks to trigger the provider build when a pact is published
* the ability to tag a pact (ie. "prod") so a provider can verify itself against a fixed version of a pact to ensure backwards compatibility.
